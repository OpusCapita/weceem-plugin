/**
 * This {@link groovy.util.ConfigObject} script provides Grails Searchable Plugin configuration.
 *
 * You can use the "environments" section at the end of the file to define per-environment
 * configuration.
 *
 * Note it is NOT required to add a reference to this file in Config.groovy; it is loaded by
 * the plugin itself.
 *
 * Available properties in the binding are:
 *
 * @param userHome The current user's home directory.
 *                 Same as System.properties['user.home']
 * @param appName The Grails environment (ie, "development", "test", "production").
 *                Same as System.properties['grails.env']
 * @param appVersion The version of your application
 * @param grailsEnv The Grails environment (ie, "development", "test", "production").
 *                  Same as System.properties['grails.env']
 *
 * You can also use System.properties to refer to other JVM properties.
 *
 * This file is created by "grails install-searchable-config", and replaces
 * the previous "SearchableConfiguration.groovy"

     * @param escape          whether to escape special characters in string queries: true|false
     * @param offset          the 0-based hit offset of the first page of results.
     *                        Normally you wouldn't change it from 0, it's only here because paging
     *                        works by using an offset + max combo for a specific page
     * @param max             the page size, for paged search results
     * @param defaultOperator if the query does not otherwise indicate, then the default operator
     *                        applied: "or" or "and".
     *                        If "and" means all terms are required for a match, if "or" means
     *                        any term is required for a match
     * @param suggestQuery    if true and search method is returning a search-result object
     *                        (rather than a domain class instance, list or count) then a
     *                        "suggestedQuery" property is also added to the search-result.
     *                        This can also be a Map of options as supported by the suggestQuery
     *                        method itself
