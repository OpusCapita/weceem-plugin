## Free Open Source and pure-Grails Content Management System plugin for [Grails](http://grails.org).

The plugin is the full implementation of a pure-Grails Content Management System that you can embed into your own
Grails applications. You can create customized CMS functionality or a hybrid application/CMS to provide user-editable
content in production. Security is completely decoupled so that you can plug in whatever security mechanism you are
using, and you can  customize the look and feel of the user interface to suit your application.

It is now compatible with **Grails 2.4.x**, current released version: **1.4** [release notes](https://github.com/OpusCapita/weceem-plugin/releases/tag/1.4)
