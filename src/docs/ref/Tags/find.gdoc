h4. Purpose

The wcm:find tag allows you to load one or more content nodes from the space.

*Example*

{code}
<wcm:find id="484" var="c">
  ${c.title.encodeAsHTML()}<br/>
</wcm:find>
{code}

The above form will retrieve a single content node identified by its internal unique id, and place it into a variable for rendering.

If no body is supplied, it will simply return the content node - this is primarily for use when invoking as a function, to manipulate the content object directly.

h4. Description

The supported attributes are:

* id (optional) - unique id of the content, numerical 
* title (optional) - title to search for
* path (optional) - the node path to search for
* status(optional) - the status of the search node, by default only public nodes are found
* var (optional) - name of the variable passed to the body containing each result
