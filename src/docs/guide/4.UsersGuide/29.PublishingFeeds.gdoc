You can expose RSS/Atom feeds of any list of child nodes in your repository with a simple tag, wcm:feedLink.

This tag will create the correct <meta> tag in the HEAD section of your HTML so that any RSS readers that request the
feed will get a list of nodes in reverse date order:

{code}
<head>
<wcm:feedLink type="rss" path="${node}"/>
</head>
{code}

This would add a feed for the children of the current page. For full details see *Tags* section.
