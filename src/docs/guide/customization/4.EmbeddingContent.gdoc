In some custom applications you may want to embed some Weceem content within your own Grails GSP views. This is easily achieved for most situations using the new *wcm:render* tag as of release 1.1. 

However, if you need to render content with more control over the process - e.g. using an artificial request/response to render content for use in emails, you can use the wcmRenderEngine bean.

This bean offers methods for rendering a specific content node. 

You must typically pass in a request and response to use - given that most of Weceem functionality uses Grails tags and these require features of requests and responses - although you can usually also pass in your own controller instance if you have one.

See the source code for "RenderEngine on github":https://github.com/jCatalog/weceem-plugin/blob/master/src/groovy/org/weceem/content/RenderEngine.groovy for more details.
